            'At Genzoic, we believe technology should make business life simpler and more effective. Our partnership with Upside Health, brought us face-to-face with a real-world problem. Upside Health runs several stores in Pune and Mumbai, offering nutrition-rich snacks, drinks, and supplements. But handling perishable items meant they often faced challenges with stock, some products would expire before being sold, while others ran out too fast.',
            'Store managers had to manually check inventory lists, which was slow and stressful. To solve this, we built a Stock Inventory Report System. This smart solution gathers the sales & inventory data from every store, predicts the expected sales and give clear instructions to the store managers how to restock & reduce wastage.'

            'Our Stock Inventory Report System acts like a digital assistant that keeps an eye on every product, every day. It analyzes store data to identify two key issues : products that are about to expire and items that are running low.',
            'Every morning, the system auto generates clear actions for the store managers advising them how to optimize the stock. It also consider the distance between the production unit to a store & the distance between two stores to optimize transportation of the products to avoid both stock outs & wastage.',
            'It also generates real actionable suggestions to the production manager about what quantities of which products are to be manufactured by when. The just-in-time-production helps improve operational efficiencies & improve margins.',
            'Upside Health\'s team now spends less time worrying about manual tracking and more time serving their customers. The result? Less waste, better stock planning, and improved customer satisfaction. This system also supports Upside Health\'s sustainable vision by reducing food waste and ensuring all stores deliver top quality products every day.'

Their team looks at the suggestions provided by the AI assistants and acts on it without spending hours on deciding the optimization strategies for the day.',
            'In the process they built stronger trust with customers who appreciate their favourite healthy snacks at the best quality and always available. Together, Genzoic and Upside Health are setting a strong example of how data, empathy, and smart design can create a more sustainable future.'
